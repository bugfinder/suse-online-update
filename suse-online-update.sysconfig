# Cleanup some left overs from former (zypper) runs in /tmp and /var/tmp.

## Type:     string
## Default:  nagios
#
# As the mentioned directories in /var/tmp/ normally belong to the user that
# executed zypper, the files can belong to any known user. 
# To avoid cleaning too much, you can limit this to a specific user, so only 
# the directories belonging to this user will be deleted. If you are sure that 
# the script should delete all directories with the names given for the RUN_CLEANUP
# variable, use leave this value empty.

## Default:  patch
#
# Zypper works with several types of resource objects, called resolvables.
# A resolvable might be a package, patch, pattern, product; basically
# any kind of object with dependencies to other objects.
#
# The default her is 'patch', which would only install official released
# package updates.
#
# If you want to update packages from 3rd party repositories (which normally
# do not provide patches) as well, please switch to 'package' here.
